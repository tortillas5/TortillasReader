# TortillasReader
WPF manga/comic reader in C# for windows.

I was not happy with the reading experience on PC for mangas/comics, so I created this reader.
Main features :
- Able to show 2 pages at a time (like when reading a real book).
- Zoom on pages (both pages zoomed as a single image on double pages).
- Dimmed mode for people like me with fragile eyes.
- Comic AND Manga mode => Switch the reading direction accordingly to the mode.
- Full screen mode.
- Themes.
- French & English languages supported (you can pull your own language if you'd like it added).

Planned features :
- Custom themes.
- Enhanced full screen mode (no bar at all at the top of the screen).
- "Smart mode" in double page mode to show two images when they are both "single page" but to show only one page when it's two pages as one.
- Recently opened files.
- Preview full manga with thumbnails.
- Linux compatibility (long term).
